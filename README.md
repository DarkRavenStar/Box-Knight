# Box-Knight
A card game (Inspired Slay the Spire) that my group did for GPS 2 (Game Studio Project 2). I was involved as gameplay, AI, UI, database and tool programmers. 


Box Knight is a 3D card-based Adventure game in which players take on the role of a Box Knight, a lone knight in a quest to defeat the demon king while wearing his cuboid armour. In the player’s journey, they will move through levels in the dungeon, encounter a variety of enemies to fight and get stronger by collecting the many cards dropped by enemies and found in chests until finally reaching the Demon King where the player’s might will be tested.
